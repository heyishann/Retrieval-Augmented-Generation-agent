# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-agent

The Retrieval Augmented Generation Agent is an intelligent AI framework designed to enhance large language model (LLM) responses with real-time, contextually relevant external knowledge. Unlike standard generative models that rely solely on pre-trained data, RAG integrates an advanced retrieval pipeline that searches structured and unstructured data from the PDF document.

Add your API key in the .env file, give path of your doucment in the RAG_agent file and run "py RAG_agent.py"
